# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview of Project

This project is an analysis of weather data to support the feasibility of opening a Surf Shop on the island of Oahu, HI.

### Results
A review of the weather in Jun and December for the island shows the following:
- The Mean Temperature between the two months differs by only 3 degrees or so. 
- However there is a wide difference between the Minimum and Maximum Temps for each of the months.
	- June: 64 to 85 degrees and December: 56 to 83 degrees
### Summary
Overall, as the day wears on, the high temperatures would allow for the casual surfer to only brave the waters in the mid part of the day. The more hardcore surfers and locals will likely be the only customers during the mornings, especially in December.
